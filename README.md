# PASSWORD MANAGER

There are 4 project files.

- `main.py` is the main file of the project.

- `passwordGenerator.py`contains the function to return a random String of password

- `logo.png` is a logo for GUI of the project. Tkinter is used to create a canvas and load this image, hence you can replace with as per your choice to change the logo.

- `data.json` is the output generated file after a user saves a password and uses it to search the website

#### Execute the `main.py` to run your project. This project also showcase Validation and Verification in form submission using messageBox of tkinter. Along with that, user can create their password or use the GENERATE PASSWORD button to get a strong password. Additional feature of the project is the SEARCHING functionality.

###### This mini project is developed to enhance learning and understanding of Python, TKinter, and advanced arguments. Anyone who wishes to explore and extend this project is welcome and I will happily add them as a collaborator. Thank you.
